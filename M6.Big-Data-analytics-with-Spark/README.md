# Big Data analytics with Spark

## Assignment

I'm analyzing search terms on the SoftCart's web server using a .csv file containing the data.

My tasks are:

- load .csv file into a Spark dataframe
- print the results of queries against this data set
- load a pre-trained sales forecasting model
- use the forecasting model to predict the sales for the next year

Assignment is done inside two Jupyter notebooks, which can be rendered on GitHub as readable documents.

These notebooks are uploaded to this module's sub-folder on GitHub.
